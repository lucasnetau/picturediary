      <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>

<div>
		<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
The Terms and Conditions apply to all video projects unless an alternative agreement was made in writing by both parties before filming. We will always do our best to fulfil your needs and meet your goals, but sometimes it is best to have a few simple things written down so that we both know what is what, who should do what and what happens if stuff goes wrong.</p>
<p>In this document, you won’t find complicated legal terms or large passages of unreadable text. We have no desire to trick you or take advantage of you. We do want what’s best for the safety of both parties, now and in the future.<br>
________________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Organising your people &amp; resources</strong></p>
<p>It’s important that everyone knows where to be and at what time. The responsibility of making sure everyone turns up on time to the specified location for filming is on the client. Furthermore, it’s important that anyone partaking in the filming process is rehearsed/briefed in their role within the video. Everyone’s time is precious and we hate wasting anyone’s.</p>
<p>Similarly, any assets required to complete the video such as logos, fonts, graphics, artwork, copywriting and other supporting resources will need to provided to us electronically BEFORE we start editing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Copyrights</strong><br>
You guarantee to us that any elements of logos, text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork that you provide us for inclusion in the video are either owned by your good selves, or that you have permission to use them.<br>
When we receive your FULL payment, copyright is automatically assigned as follows:<br>
You own the videos that we create for you. We will send you a link to all videos where you will be able to download all videos. You should store them really safely as we are not required to keep them or provide any native source files that we used in making them.<br>
We love to show off our work and share what we have learned with other people, so we also reserve the right to display and link to your completed videos as part of our portfolio and to write about the project on web sites, in magazine articles and in books about video or media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Payment Terms</strong><br>
We are sure you understand how important it is that you pay your invoices on the due date. As we’re also sure you’ll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tight to the following payment terms.<br>
All fees are payable by Direct Bank Deposit to:<br>
The Picture Diary Pty Ltd<br>
BSB – 032 059<br>
ACCOUNT – 316751</p>
<p>Video projects quoted above $5,000 (excl GST) will require a 30% deposit paid BEFORE filming starts. The balance will be payable upon final video approval.<br>
All other videos will require FULL payment 10 business days after invoicing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Failure to pay</strong><br>
If accounts are not settled or The Picture Diary have not been contacted regarding the delay before the payment due date, access to videos may be denied and links removed.<br>
Following continued non-payment of the fees our solicitors will contact the client in question, with a view to taking the matter further and if need be to seek payment through legal procedures.<br>
Any costs incurred while trying to recover payment from the client will be the responsibility of the client and added to the client’s invoice.<br>
The Picture Diary retains full ownership of all work including concepts and raw video footage until full payment is made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In closing</strong><br>
Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and any breach of our terms and conditions will result in us blocking you from our friends list and taking the necessary measures to ensure both parties are safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any part of the terms &amp; conditions are unclear, or you want to negotiate other terms, please contact us via email as outlined on our website: www.thepicturediary.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also call Lieutenant Tom on 0448 462 002 to have a chat.</p>
